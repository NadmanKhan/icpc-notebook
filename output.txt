	      Erdos Gallai Theorem:
	      The degree sequence of an undirected graph is the non-increasing sequence of its vertex
	      degrees
	      A sequence of non-negative integers $d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n$ can be represented as the
	      degree
	      sequence of finite simple graph on $n$ vertices if and only if $d_1 + d_2 + \cdots + d_n$ is even
	      and

	      \[\displaystyle \sum_{i = 1}^k {d_i \leq k(k - 1)} + \sum_{i = k + 1}^n \min(d_i, k)\]
	      holds for every $\displaystyle \displaystyle k$ in $\displaystyle 1 \leq k \leq n$.
